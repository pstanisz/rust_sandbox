# Hello, Rust!

This is a typical "Hello, World!" application written in Rust.

## main

The first code that runs in every executable Rust program.

```rust
fn main {
}
```

## println!

Calls a Rust macro, which prints out the text to the screen.

```rust
println!("Hello, rust!");
```

## Compilation

Just an easy step to compile:

```shell
rustc main.rs
```

To run the application:

```shell
./main
```
